Welcome to 8 Ball Pool! This is a simulation of 8 ball in reality. Within the simulation, there is an optimal angle feature that shows where the pool ball may travel after coming in contact with the cue ball. Furthermore, there is accurate physics calculated without the help of physics engines to emulate the physics involved in pool (i.e. collisions and border deflection).
To Run the project:

Simply run the file poolGame.py

Libraries: The only library involved is PyGame

Shortcuts: The only shortcut to ending the game is to pot the eight ball (the black ball) in one of the 6 pockets on the pool table.
